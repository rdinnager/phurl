Description: phurl runs phylogenetic models (e.g trait evolution models, diversification models) by parameterizing them as a simple linear model and using regularization to achieve identifiability and possibly also sparsity, depending on the model. This can be a powerful approach for certain tasks, being computationally efficient and unlocking the power of the linear model for phylogenetic studies.
