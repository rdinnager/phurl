#Bayesian Ridge Regression Equations

The Bayesian version of Ridge regression treats the \eqn{\beta} coefficients as being drawn from a
gaussian distribution with mean 0 and a shared standard deviation. This standard deviation parameter itself
has an inverse gamma prior distribution. This has the effect of "shrinking" coefficients towards zero where the
strength of this shrinkage is inversely proportional to the gaussian standard deviation. E.g.:
$$y_i \sim f\left(\mu_i, \phi\right)$$

$$g\left(\mu\right) = \alpha + \sum_j\beta_jx_i$$
$$\beta_j \sim \text{Normal}\left(0, \tau\right)$$

$$\tau \sim \text{InvGamma}\left(1, 1\right)$$

y_i = f(μ, φ)

           \         
g(μ) = α + /   beta_j
           ===       
            j        
                     
beta_j = Normal(0, τ)
                     
τ = InvGamma(1, 1)
